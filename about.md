<p>International Ambassadors at Georgia Tech (GTIA) is made up of some of the best talent Georgia Tech can offer, with members from around the world and across Tech’s disciplines.<br><br>

With just over 60 tight-knit members, representing over 20 nationalities from 5 continents, we are an organization that champions international culture and diversity. We believe that in our differences there is beauty, strength and inspiration to do more.<br><br>

Our talented, hardworking and honestly pretty cool members are the main reason our organization has grown in our role in the Georgia Tech community at such a great rate over the last few years. We have grown from solely a student recruitment team, to a student organization that holds multiple events for the international community through the year – from Career Fairs to Movie Nights – and caters to a community of Yellow Jackets both on campus and around the world.
