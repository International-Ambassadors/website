<!-- Introduction -->
Contrary to popular belief, Tech student life expands beyond just the rigorous study and hours of research. Here’s what Tech has to offer to the non-academic aspect of student life. <br><br>

    <dt>GTIA</dt>
    <dd>
        <div class="12u">
            <ul>
                <li>GTIA is a local hub for international students and domestic students to improve GT’s international atmosphere. </li>
                <li>GTIA hosts events that bring together international students at Tech, and share their own cultures - diffusing culture through Georgia Tech.</li>
                <li>GTIA brings the world to Georgia Tech and Georgia Tech to the world</li>

    <dt>Orgsync</dt>
    <dd>
        <a href="https://orgsync.com/136728/chapter">OrgSync</a> is a website where you can find a description of each organization and the contact details for its Executive Board since Georgia Tech has over 400 student organizations to cater the interests of its diverse student body. <br><br>

    <dt>Greek Life</dt>
    <dd>
        Approximately 37% of our student population is Greek, which means that they are affiliated to a sorority or fraternity. The <a href="http://www.greek.gatech.edu/">Greek Community</a> at Georgia Tech is diverse and inclusive. If you are considering going through joining a Greek Organization, know that the Tech Greek Experience is unique and does not conform to the stereotypical greek experience showcased in popular culture. More about the basics of Greek Life can be found <a href="http://www.campusexplorer.com/college-advice-tips/AB7769A2/What-is-Greek-Life/">here</a>. <br><br>

    <dt>Honor Societies</dt>
    <dd>
        Georgia Tech is an academically focused school with a stimulating environment. We have a lot of honor societies that facilitate the development of leaders with a strong scholastic record. One example is the Briaerean Honor Society that recognizes co-op students with an exemplary academic record. <br><br>
    </dd>
    <dt>Cultural Organizations</dt>
    <dd>
        Our campus is diverse and this is something we take a lot of pride in. Cultural Organizations can help students find a group of like-minded peers and feel a sense of community at a college as large as Georgia Tech. The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and India Club are two of the biggest cultural organizations at Tech. <br><br>
    </dd>
    <dt>Traditions</dt>
    <dd>
        Knowing the <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/about/history-traditions">traditions</a> at Tech will allow new students to see the values we take pride in and feel a part of the school and history. <a href="http://traditions.gatech.edu/tbook.html">T-Book</a> provides an overview of the Ramblin’ Reck, GT history, traditions, Alumni, Fans and Spirit and Athletics. <br><br>
        <div class="12u">
            <ul>
                <li><i>Homecoming:</i> It gives Yellow Jackets of all ages an opportunity to have fun while showing their school spirit. Some of the traditional events and activities are Mini 500 Race, the Freshmen Cake Race, and the Ramblin’ Wreck Parade, etc. See the video <a href="https://youtu.be/VUz6P2U-w-4">here</a>.</li>
                <li><i>Freshmen Cake Race:</i> All participants receive cupcakes at the finish line. Whether participating or viewing, the race is a fun event and one of Tech’s oldest traditions.</li>
